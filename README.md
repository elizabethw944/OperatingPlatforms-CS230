For this project, the client was The Gaming Room, they requested a design for a web-based game called Draw It or Lose It, that would work across multiple platforms while supporting multiplayer functionality.
They needed features like unique player and team identifiers, single-instance control to avoid duplication, while also making sure the game would scale smoothly even as the player base grew. 
One area I feel I did well was being able to explain technical ideas or details in a clear way. I tried to make some of the more complex ideas like storage managment, distributed systems, and security 
easier to understand for both technical and non-technical audiences. 
Working through the design document, I found that it helped me think through each step of the software's structure and development. Creating a detailed design helped me think more about potential problems and 
ways to address those issues early on which would helps make the overall build more efficient.
If I could improve any section, it would probably be the platform evaluation. I would want to go into more detail on comparing cost, licensing, and potential limitations to give the client more information for
decision-making.
To meet the needs of the users I mainly focused on accessibilty, reliability, and security since users would be playing on different devices. Making sure to meet user needs is vital because even a well-built product will
not succeed if it doesnt deliver a smooth and enjoyable experience for the users. 
My approach to the design involved breaking down the problems in to smaller pieces starting with the client's needs, then focused on technical needs, then onto user experience and security. In the future, I would continue using this approach but
would also want spend some time building and testing the program to better balance planning alongside hands-on development.
